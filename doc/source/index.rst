===========================================
 Welcome to NWCSAF/MPPP's documentation!
===========================================

NWCSAF's Meteorological Post-Processing Package is a python library for
generating RGB products for meteorological remote sensing. As such it can
create RGB composites directly from satellite instrument channels, or take
advantage of precomputed PGEs.

It is designed to be easily extendable to support any meteorological satellite
by the creation of plugins. In the base distribution, we provide support for
Meteosat 8 and 9.
